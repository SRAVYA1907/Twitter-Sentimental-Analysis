set representing the current public perceptions of the candidates is collected
via Twitter. The dataset is created with the help of twitter APIâ€™s. For the
collected tweets, we calculate the polarity and subjectivity measures to
understand the user sentiment for a specific candidate. The collected tweets
are analyzed using a lexicon based approach to determine the sentiments of
the public . Moreover, the candidates are compared in terms of the sentiment
type. Textblob package is used toper form simple text classification in either
positive or negative on the basis of sentiment analysis. totally, a word cloud
that represents the tweets and most frequently used words is generated.
